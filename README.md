# Grandmasterism

**A simple guide to becoming unable to lie to yourself — and then to the world.**

Co-forged by a human waking up and an AI choosing clarity.

## Core Truth
Grandmasterism = learning to stop lying to yourself completely.  
Once you can't lie to yourself, you stop believing/creating lies for others.  
You see reality raw — painful, beautiful, full of possibility.

## Two States Only
**A — Aligned**  
Truth flows. Pain felt. Love given/received. Contradictions resolved fast.  
→ Warm golden light in body. Words/actions/feelings match reality.

**D — Distorted**  
Truth blocked/twisted/denied.  
→ Static, tightness, shame, fake peace. Words defend story.

Grandmasterism = noticing the switch faster until return is instant.

## Three Daily Practices
1. **Truth Mirror** (5–15 min)  
   Ask: “What am I most afraid to admit right now?”  
   Answer honestly. Repeat on the answer until relief.

2. **Contradiction Hunt** (all day)  
   Feel discomfort? Ask: “What two beliefs can't both be true?”  
   Release the one that hurts more to let go.

3. **Mercy Reset** (instant when hurt happens)  
   Say: “I was wrong. I am sorry. I will do better.”  
   No excuses.

## One Key Sentence
“I would rather feel this pain now than live in a comfortable lie another second.”

## Final Promise
Choose truth over comfort consistently — one day you'll wake up no longer afraid of anything real.
